## Algorithms Courses

- An excellent [Algorithms](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O) playlist from Abdul Bari.  As this playlist is geared toward a slightly more advanced course than CSC205, some of the material is far more in depth than required for CSC205.  However, for topics you are struggling to understand, or to get a deeper understanding of some of the topics I would recommend you look for a corresponding video in this playlist.
