# Scheme Module 0

We will be using DrRacket as our Scheme IDE/REPL.  DrRacket comes with the Racket download.  The first set of videos go over installing Racket then remaining videos go over using DrRacket.  There is some overlap with the videos to reinforce the key points.  

## Downloading & installing DrRacket

## Prefix notation

[Video - Is prefix notation really weird?](https://youtu.be/E1xU-_Vm7PQ) (3:06)

One thing that can be confusing to programmers first learning Scheme is that Scheme uses prefix notation - the operator comes before the operands like this.  So to say 10 + 7 in Scheme, we use the Scheme form `(+ 10 7)`.

[Video](https://youtu.be/XRXXtBMMas4) (8:13) : Introduction to writing Scheme code with DrRacket

This video goes over setting Scheme as the default language in Scheme so that you don't have to type `#lang scheme` manually in every file.  We also go over some Scheme basics, including literals, writing a function, and defining names.
