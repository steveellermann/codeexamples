- This [podcast about makefiles](http://www.programmingthrowdown.com/2012/06/episode-16-build-automation.html) was posted by a student a few semesters ago. A student posted this about the episode: *Interesting podcast article that highlights some other topics regarding make files and their benefits/drawbacks.  The two speakers work in the industry and a few good highlights from their perspective working on commercial teams. The first portion of the episode is entertaining but not on topic (every episode is like that).  The tools of the bi-week are useful though.*
Please note this was from June 27, 2012. They also have episodes about C, C++ and Unix along with many other languages.
