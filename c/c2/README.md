# C Pointers

Note - I strongly recommend using a static analysis tool such as cppcheck (See [this video](https://youtu.be/oJ8SXVoefaA)) (3:37) when working with pointers to help you avoid common mistakes.

## Introduction to pointers

The following videos introduce pointers and show how they relate to arrays and strings.  

### pointer.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/dc8euF3aIVc) (11:02) - *Pointers, referencing & dereferencing, allocating memory, sizeof pointers*
This file has examples of referencing & dereferencing pointers and variables.  malloc allocates a certain number of bytes.  If you want to allocate an array, make sure you allocate the number of elements you want times the size of the type of the array.

### pointerarithmetic.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/pBrCD9A_i_w) (15:06) - *Pointer arithmetic*
This file has examples of how arithmetic with pointers works.

### arrayvsptr.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/DhoPMlB4RiE) (14:09) - *Using array names & pointers*
This file has examples showing the similarities & differences between pointers.  If we declare a variable with type `char *` then it is a pointer.  A variable with type `char[]` is an array.  We can use the *names* of pointers and arrays in the same way (as shown in this example), so in that way they are similar.  However, an array variable has memory allocated for it whereas a pointer variable does not - it only has memory allocated to hold an address.

### structptr.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/IgqKL9Nr63A) (12:16) - *Struct pointers*
This file has an example of using a pointer to a struct.

### doublepointer.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/P2B1FT8okyc) (10:22) - *Double pointers*

Double pointers are simply pointers that hold the address of a pointer.  This video starts off with a review of pointers then discusses double pointers with an example of a function that takes a double pointer as a parameter.  

### voidpointer.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/6ahM6eSxgUU) (7:58) - *void pointers*
This file has an example of working with void pointers.

### alloc.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/i0N4f2AcAS0) (29:10) - *Examples of allocating memory, including arrays and structs*
malloc, calloc, puts, exit

Note that after the video ended line 33 of alloc.c was changed to ```if(nums == NULL) {``` to correct the variable name.

### splat.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/mSVhgq2Czqg) (5:51) - *The different ways you can use a star/asterisk/splat in C*

This is to help review how the * is used in C.

### pointer_review.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/oGiUw35seyE) (23:10) - *Overview of pointer usage in C*
This file has several different examples of using pointers, including an example of using malloc to allocate memory. 

## Strings & Pointers

### stringvsptr.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/tymWEU5YHAQ) (18:43) - *Pointers, referencing & dereferencing, allocating memory, sizeof pointers*
This file has examples of referencing & dereferencing pointers and variables.  malloc allocates a certain number of bytes.  If you want to allocate an array, make sure you allocate the number of elements you want times the size of the type of the array.

### stringfunctions.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/kiYo4G1XqL4) (29:26) - *Example of writing functions with string parameters & C string functions*
strncpy, strcat, strncmp, sprintf

## Advanced pointer examples

### memdump.c

First, a refresher on [converting hex values to binary](https://youtu.be/EXyDKPDfX8I) (2:20).  We will be looking at hex values for each bytes.  Two hex values represent one byte which is 8 bits.  

[Video](https://youtu.be/cUf0rzF17_M) (10:42) - *Examining memory byte-by-byte*
Example function that will print out memory byte-by-byte using a char pointer.  In this example we use the function to examine the contents of a struct.

### morearrayptr.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/XLxG70C3ers) (13:12) - *Two dimensional arrays, accessing elements of an array using a pointer*
This file has an example of a 1D & 2D array and how to access their members.

### raggedstringarray.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/Vos7q5mvZOE) (4:25) - *Example of allocating strings in an array of pointers vs an array of arrays (2D array)*
There are multiple ways of creating an array of strings.  In this example we compare allocating arrays of strings as arrays of pointers and arrays of arrays.

### memorylocation.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/1ow7JAahG0s) (13:08) - *Examples of allocation of different memory locations*
This file has examples of allocating heap, stack, & static memory.

### debug.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/A7wuwnkcGPY) (9:29) - *Using the preprocessor for debugging*
This file has examples of using the preprocessor to allow a file to be compiled to display debugging information.  This is optional, but you may find it helpful to do something similar with your code to help you debug your program.
